# Weather Dashboard

## Description: 
### This is a weather dashboard which generates weather data by city as well as the future 5 days of data of a desired (US) city. 

## WHAT WHY & HOW 
### Want to generate a functional weather dashboard by using the OpenWeather API and Javascript and below is the user story and acceptance criteria 


## USER STORY
### AS A traveler
### I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
### SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly


## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
### GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
### WHEN I search for a city
### THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
### WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
### THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
### WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
### THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
### WHEN I click on a city in the search history
### THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## CHALLENGES & TO BE UPDATED
### Many challenges presented itself as I am writing the code- specifically having trouble with getting the api to work to generate any data. With the OpenWeather API taking in longitudes and latitudes, the biggest challenge is converting the city to coordinates in order to find the correct data for the correct location.As a result, no data was able to be displayed or stored in local storage. Due to time constraint, i will have to come back and work on this further.
